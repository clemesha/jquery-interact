======================================================
An implementation of Sage's ``interact`` functionality
======================================================

``interact`` is a way to dynamically manipulate the
arguements to an function, and see the result change
very convienently.


This goal of this project is to have:
-------------------------------------
    1) A stand-alone version of interact
    2) Versions in pure JavaScript and also Python backed.
    3) Integrate into Codenode, and hopefully Sage.
